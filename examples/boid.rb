  # Rule 1: Boids try to fly towards the centre of mass of neighbouring
  #         boids.
  #
  # The 'centre of mass' is simply the average position of all the boids.
  # I use the term centre of mass by analogy with the corresponding
  # physical formula (however we ignore individual masses here and treat
  # all boids having the same mass).
  #
  # Assume we have N boids, called b1, b2, ..., bN. Also, the position of
  # a boid b is denoted b.position. Then the 'centre of mass' c of all N
  # boids is given by:
  #
  #   c = (b1.position + b2.position + ... + bN.position) / N
  #
  # Remember that the positions here are vectors, and N is a scalar.
  #
  # However, the 'centre of mass' is a property of the entire flock; it is
  # not something that would be considered by an individual boid. I prefer
  # to move the boid toward its 'perceived centre', which is the centre of
  # all the other boids, not including itself. Thus, for boidJ (1 <= J <=
  # N), the perceived centre pcJ is given by:
  #
  #   pcJ = (b1.position + b2.position + ... + bJ-1.position +
  #     bJ+1.position + ... + bN.position) / (N-1)
  #
  # Having calculated the perceived centre, we need to work out how to
  # move the boid towards it. To move it 1% of the way towards the centre
  # (this is about the factor I use) this is given by (pcJ - bJ.position)
  # / 100.
  #
  # Summarising this in pseudocode:
  #
  #   PROCEDURE rule1(boid bJ)
  #
  #     Vector pcJ
  #
  #     FOR EACH BOID b
  #       IF b != bJ THEN
  #         pcJ = pcJ + b.position
  #       END IF
  #     END
  #
  #     pcJ = pcJ / N-1
  #
  #     RETURN (pcJ - bJ.position) / 100
  #
  #   END PROCEDURE
  #
  # Thus we have calculated the first vector offset, v1, for the boid.

  # Rule 2: Boids try to keep a small distance away from other objects
  # (including other boids).
  #
  # The purpose of this rule is to for boids to make sure they don't
  # collide into each other. I simply look at each boid, and if it's
  # within a defined small distance (say 100 units) of another boid move
  # it as far away again as it already is. This is done by subtracting
  # from a vector c the displacement of each boid which is near by. We
  # initialise c to zero as we want this rule to give us a vector which
  # when added to the current position moves a boid away from those near
  # it.
  #
  # In pseudocode:
  #
  #   PROCEDURE rule2(boid bJ)
  #
  #     Vector c = 0;
  #
  #     FOR EACH BOID b
  #       IF b != bJ THEN
  #         IF |b.position - bJ.position| < 100 THEN
  #           c = c - (b.position - bJ.position)
  #         END IF
  #       END IF
  #     END
  #
  #     RETURN c
  #
  #   END PROCEDURE
  #
  # It may seem odd that we choose to simply double the distance from
  # nearby boids, as it means that boids which are very close are not
  # immediately "repelled". Remember that if two boids are near each
  # other, this rule will be applied to both of them. They will be
  # slightly steered away from each other, and at the next time step if
  # they are still near each other they will be pushed further apart.
  # Hence, the resultant repulsion takes the form of a smooth
  # acceleration. It is a good idea to maintain a principle of ensuring
  # smooth motion. If two boids are very close to each other it's probably
  # because they have been flying very quickly towards each other,
  # considering that their previous motion has also been restrained by
  # this rule. Suddenly jerking them away from each other, such that they
  # each have their motion reversed, would appear unnatural, as if they
  # bounced off each other's invisible force fields. Instead, we have them
  # slow down and accelerate away from each other until they are far
  # enough apart for our liking.

  def rule2
    c = XY::ZERO
    hits = 0

    nearby.each do |b|
      diff = b.position - self.position
      next unless diff.magnitude.abs < TOO_CLOSE

# Further tweaks
#
# The three boids rules sufficiently demonstrate a complex emergent
# flocking behaviour. They are all that is required to simulate a
# distributed, leaderless flocking behaviour. However in order to make
# other aspects of the behaviour more life-like, extra rules and
# limitations can be implemented.
#
# These rules will simply be called in the
# move_all_boids_to_new_positions() procedure as follows:
#
#   PROCEDURE move_all_boids_to_new_positions()
#
#                 Vector v1, v2, v3, v4, ...
#
#                 FOR EACH BOID b
#                         v1 = rule1(b)
#                         v2 = rule2(b)
#                         v3 = rule3(b)
#       v4 = rule4(b)
#          .
#                            .
#                            .
#
#                         b.velocity = b.velocity + v1 + v2 + v3 + v4 + ...
#                         b.position = b.position + b.velocity
#                 END
#
#         END PROCEDURE
#
# Hence each of the following rules is implemented as a new procedure
# returning a vector to be added to a boid's velocity.
#
# Goal setting
#
# Reynolds [1] uses goal setting to steer a flock down a set path or in
# a general direction, as required to ensure generally predictable
# motion for use in computer animations and film work. I have not used
# such goal setting in my simulations, however here are some example
# implementations:
#
# Action of a strong wind or current
#
# For example, to simulate fish schooling in a moving river or birds
# flying through a strong breeze.
#
#   PROCEDURE strong_wind(Boid b)
#     Vector wind
#
#     RETURN wind
#   END PROCEDURE
#
# This function returns the same value independent of the boid being
# examined; hence the entire flock will have the same push due to the
# wind.
#
# Tendency towards a particular place
#
# For example, to steer a sparse flock of sheep or cattle to a narrow
# gate. Upon reaching this point, the goal for a particular boid could
# be changed to encourage it to move away to make room for other members
# of the flock. Note that if this 'gate' is flanked by impenetrable
# objects as accounted for in Rule 2 above, then the flock will
# realistically mill around the gate and slowly trickle through it.
#
#   PROCEDURE tend_to_place(Boid b)
#     Vector place
#
#     RETURN (place - b.position) / 100
#   END PROCEDURE
#
# Note that this rule moves the boid 1% of the way towards the goal at
# each step. Especially for distant goals, one may want to limit the
# magnitude of the returned vector.
#
# Limiting the speed
#
# I find it a good idea to limit the magnitude of the boids' velocities,
# this way they don't go too fast. Without such limitations, their speed
# will actually fluctuate with a flocking-like tendency, and it is
# possible for them to momentarily go very fast. We assume that real
# animals can't go arbitrarily fast, and so we limit the boids' speed.
# (Note that I am using the physical definitions of velocity and speed
# here; velocity is a vector and thus has both magnitude and direction,
# whereas speed is a scalar and is equal to the magnitude of the
# velocity).
#
# For a limiting speed vlim:
#
#         PROCEDURE limit_velocity(Boid b)
#                 Integer vlim
#                 Vector v
#
#                 IF |b.velocity| > vlim THEN
#                         b.velocity = (b.velocity / |b.velocity|) * vlim
#                 END IF
#         END PROCEDURE
#
# This procedure creates a unit vector by dividing b.velocity by its
# magnitude, then multiplies this unit vector by vlim. The resulting
# velocity vector has the same direction as the original velocity but
# with magnitude vlim.
#
# Note that this procedure operates directly on b.velocity, rather than
# returning an offset vector. It is not used like the other rules;
# rather, this procedure is called after all the other rules have been
# applied and before calculating the new position, ie. within the
# procedure move_all_boids_to_new_positions:
#
#                         b.velocity = b.velocity + v1 + v2 + v3 + ...
#                         limit_velocity(b)
#                         b.position = b.position + b.velocity
# Bounding the position
#
# In order to keep the flock within a certain area (eg. to keep them
# on-screen) Rather than unrealistically placing them within some
# confines and thus bouncing off invisible walls, we implement a rule
# which encourages them to stay within rough boundaries. That way they
# can fly out of them, but then slowly turn back, avoiding any harsh
# motions.
#
#   PROCEDURE bound_position(Boid b)
#     Integer Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax, Zmin, Zmax
#     Vector v
#
#     IF b.position.x < Xmin THEN
#       v.x = 10
#     ELSE IF b.position.x > Xmax THEN
#       v.x = -10
#     END IF
#     IF b.position.y < Ymin THEN
#       v.y = 10
#     ELSE IF b.position.y > Ymax THEN
#       v.y = -10
#     END IF
#     IF b.position.z < Zmin THEN
#       v.z = 10
#     ELSE IF b.position.z > Zmax THEN
#       v.z = -10
#     END IF
#
#     RETURN v
#   END PROCEDURE
#
# Here of course the value 10 is an arbitrary amount to encourage them
# to fly in a particular direction.
#
# Perching
#
# The desired behaviour here has the boids occasionally landing and
# staying on the ground for a brief period of time before returning to
# the flock. This is accomplished by simply holding the boid on the
# ground for a breif period (of random length) whenever it gets to
# ground level, and then letting it go.
#
# When checking the bounds, we test if the boid is at or below ground
# level, and if so we make it perch. We introduce the Boolean b.perching
# for each boid b. In addition, we introduce a timer b.perch_timer which
# determines how long the boid will perch for. We make this a random
# time, assuming we are simulating the boid eating or resting.
#
# Thus, within the bound_position procedure, we add the following lines:
#
#                 Integer GroundLevel
#
#     ...
#
#                 IF b.position.y < GroundLevel THEN
#                         b.position.y = GroundLevel
#                         b.perching = True
#                 END IF
#
# It is held on the ground by simply not applying the boids rules to its
# behaviour (obviously, as we don't want it to move). Thus, before
# attempting to apply the rules we check if the boid is perching, and if
# so we decrement the timer b.perch_timer and skip the rest of the loop.
# If the boid has finished perching then we reset the b.perching flag to
# allow it to return to the flock.
#
#         PROCEDURE move_all_boids_to_new_positions()
#
#                 Vector v1, v2, v3, ...
#     Boid b
#
#                 FOR EACH BOID b
#
#                         IF b.perching THEN
#         IF b.perch_timer > 0 THEN
#           b.perch_timer = b.perch_timer - 1
#           NEXT
#         ELSE
#           b.perching = FALSE
#         END IF
#       END IF
#
#
#                         v1 = rule1(b)
#                         v2 = rule2(b)
#                         v3 = rule3(b)
#       ...
#
#                         b.velocity = b.velocity + v1 + v2 + v3 + ...
#       ...
#                         b.position = b.position + b.velocity
#                 END
#         END PROCEDURE
#
# Note that nothing else needs to be done to simulate the perching
# behaviour. As soon as we re-apply the boids rules this boid will fly
# directly towards the flock and continue on as normal.
#
# A detail I implement here is that the lower bound for the boids'
# motion is actually a little above ground level. That way the boids are
# actually discouraged from going too near the ground, and when they do
# go to the ground they land gently rather than ploughing into it as
# there is an upward push from the bounding rule. They also land less
# often which stops them becoming too lazy.
#
# Anti-flocking behaviour
#
# During the course of a simulation, one may want to break up the flock
# for various reasons. For example the introduction of a predator may
# cause the flock to scatter in all directions.
#
# Scattering the flock
#
# Here we simply want the flock to disperse; they are not necessarily
# moving away from any particular object, we just want to break the
# cohesion (for example, the flock is startled by a loud noise). Thus we
# actually want to negate part of the influence of the boids rules.
#
# Of the three rules, it turns out we only want to negate the first one
# (moving towards the centre of mass of neighbours) -- ie. we want to
# make the boids move away from the centre of mass. As for the other
# rules: negating the second rule (avoiding nearby objects) will simply
# cause the boids to actively run into each other, and negating the
# third rule (matching velocity with nearby boids) will introduce a
# semi-chaotic oscillation.
#
# It is a good idea to use non-constant multipliers for each of the
# rules, allowing you to vary the influence of each rule over the course
# of the simulation. If you put these multipliers in the
# move_all_boids_to_new_positions procedure, ending up with something
# like:
#
#         PROCEDURE move_all_boids_to_new_positions()
#
#                 Vector v1, v2, v3, ...
#     Integer m1, m2, m3, ...
#     Boid b
#
#                 FOR EACH BOID b
#
#       ...
#
#                         v1 = m1 * rule1(b)
#                         v2 = m2 * rule2(b)
#                         v3 = m3 * rule3(b)
#       ...
#
#                         b.velocity = b.velocity + v1 + v2 + v3 + ...
#       ...
#                         b.position = b.position + b.velocity
#                 END
#
#         END PROCEDURE
#
# then, during the course of the simulation, simply make m1 negative to
# scatter the flock. Setting m1 to a positive value again will cause the
# flock to spontaneously re-form.
#
# Tendency away from a particular place
#
# If, on the other hand, we want the flock to continue the flocking
# behaviour but to move away from a particular place or object (such as
# a predator), then we need to move each boid individually away from
# that point. The calculation required is identical to that of moving
# towards a particular place, implemented above as tend_to_place; all
# that is required is a negative multiplier:
#
#       Vector v
#       Integer m
#       Boid b
#
#       ...
#
#       v = -m * tend_to_place(b)
#
# So we see that each of the extra routines are very simple to
# implement, as are the initial rules. We achieve complex, life-like
# behaviour by combining all of them together. By varying the influence
# of each rule over time we can change the behaviour of the flock to
# respond to events in the environment such as sounds, currents and
# predators.
#
# Auxiliary functions
#
# You will find it handy to set up a set of Vector manipulation routines
# first to do addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication and
# division. For example, all the additions and subtractions in the above
# pseudocode are vector operations, so for example the line:
#
#       pcJ = pcJ + b.position
#
# will end up looking something like:
#
#       pcJ = Vector_Add(pcJ, b.position)
#
# where Vector_Add is a procedure defined thus:
#
#   PROCEDURE Vector_Add(Vector v1, Vector v2)
#
#     Vector v
#
#     v.x = v1.x + v2.x
#     v.y = v1.y + v2.y
#     v.z = v1.z + v2.z
#
#     RETURN v
#
#   END PROCEDURE
#
# and the line:
#
#       pcJ = pcJ / N-1
#
# will be something like:
#
#       pcJ = Vector_Div(pcJ, N-1)
#
# where Vector_Div is a scalar division:
#
#   PROCEDURE Vector_Div(Vector v1, Integer A)
#     Vector v
#
#     v.x = v1.x / A
#     v.y = v1.y / A
#     v.z = v1.z / A
#
#     RETURN v
#   END PROCEDURE
#
# Of course if you're doing this in two dimensions you won't need the
# z-axis terms, and if you're doing this in more than three dimensions
# you'll need to add more terms :)
