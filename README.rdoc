== DESCRIPTION:

Graphics provides a simple framework to implement games and/or
simulations and is designed to follow mathematical conventions, NOT
game programming conventions. Particularly it:

* Uses degrees.
* Draws in quadrant 1 (0-90 degrees).
* Right hand rule: 0 degrees is east, 90 is north, etc.

These allow simple things like Trigonometry functions to work as
expected. It means that all that stuff you were taught in grade school
still work as intended. This makes one less thing you have to adjust
when implementing your simulation.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* REAL MATHS!
* Simple drawing primitives.
* PRETTY drawing primitives! Nearly everything is anti-aliased.
* Plenty of helpers to make your code clean

== SYNOPSIS:

    class Ball < Graphics::Body
      def initialize w
        super

        # ...
      end

      def draw
        w.angle x, y, a, 10+3*m, :red
        w.circle x, y, 5, :white, :filled
      end

      def update
        fall
        move
        bounce
      end

      # ...
    end

    class BounceSimulation < Graphics::Simulation
      attr_accessor :bs

      def initialize
        super 640, 640, 16, "Bounce"

        self.bs = populate Ball
      end

      def update n
        bs.each(&:update)
      end

      def draw n
        clear
        bs.each(&:draw)
        fps n
      end

      # ...
    end

    BounceSimulation.new.run

See examples/*.rb for more

== REQUIREMENTS:

* rsdl
* libsdl & friends

See and/or run graphics_setup.sh. If you're on OSX and have homebrew
installed, running this will ensure you have a working setup.

You may want to run `brew update` beforehand to ensure you get
up-to-date versions.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install graphics
